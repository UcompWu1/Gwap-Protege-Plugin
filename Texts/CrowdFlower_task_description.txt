Class Relevance Check:
Your task is to decide if a given concept (also called class) is relevant for a given domain. This means, for example,
that the term is very likely to appear in an article talking about the domain.

Examples:

Is "game" relevant to the domain of tennis?       -- Correct answer: Yes
Is "election" relevant to the domain of politics? -- Correct answer: Yes

Is "party system" relevant to the domain of politics?  -- Correct answer: Yes
Is "partysystem" relevant to the domain of politics?  -- Correct answer: No, this is no English term!


Sometimes there is no answer that is clearly correct, because the concept may be slightly relevant, 
too generic, or too specific.
Examples:
Is human relevant to the domain of politics?      -- Unclear, probably: Yes, but very generic.
Is weather relevant to the domain of politics?    -- Unclear, probably: No, only slightly relevant.
Is event relevant to the domain of politics?      -- Unclear, but probably: Yes.
