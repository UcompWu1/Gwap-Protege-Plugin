\begin{abstract}
Recent years have seen an increase in the use of crowdsourcing based methods at various stages of the ontology engineering lifecycle (e.g., verification of subsumption, assigning equivalences between concepts etc) thus laying the foundations of a novel approach to ontology engineering. Take up of this early research by the community at large, especially by practitioners, is however currently hampered by 1) a lack of understanding of which stages of the ontology engineering process can be crowdsourced and 2) tool support in ontology engineering platforms that would allow easy insertion of crowdsourcing into ontology engineering workflows. In this paper we perform an overview of recent works in the area and take a scenario-based approach to identifying those stages of the OE process where crowdsourcing makes sense. Then, we present the “uComp Protege plugin”, a plugin for the popular Protege ontology engineering platform that facilitates the integration of crowdsourcing stages into the OE process. TBD: clarify novelty (e.g., which new tasks we introduce?), sum up some important evaluation results.

\section{Introduction}

[TBD - what is ontology engineering - and how it is always more distributed - WebProtege, GATE TEamWare - to create semantic annotations on text]

Crowdsourcing techniques allow outsourcing a task to ``an undefined, generally large group of people in the form of an open call"~\cite{Howe2009} and are usually classified in three major genres depending on the motivation of the human contributors (e.g., payment vs. fun vs. altruism).  Mechanised labour (MLab) is a type of paid-for crowdsourcing, where contributors choose to carry out small tasks (or micro-tasks) and are paid a small amount of money in return (often referred to as micro-payments). The most popular platform for mechanised labour is Amazon`s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) which allows requesters to post their micro-tasks in the form of Human Intelligence Tasks (or HITs) to a large population of micro-workers (often referred to as “turkers”). Most projects use crowdsourcing marketplaces such as MTurk and CrowdFlower (CF), where contributors are extrinsically motivated through economic incentives. Games with a purpose (GWAPs) enable human contributors to carry out computation tasks as a side effect of playing online games~\cite{vonAhn2008}.  % An example from the area of computational biology is the Phylo game (phylo.cs.mcgill.ca) that disguises the problem of multiple sequence alignment as a puzzle like game thus “intentionally decoupling the scientific problem from the game itself” (Kawrykow et al, 2008). The challenges in using GWAPs in scientific context are in designing appealing games and attracting a critical mass of players.
Finally, altruistic crowdsourcing refers to cases where a task is carried out by a large number of volunteer contributors, such as in the case of the  Galaxy Zoo (www.galaxyzoo.org) project where over 250K volunteers willing to help with scientific research classified Hubble Space Telescope galaxy images (150M galaxy classifications). 


After concluding that micro-workers are a viable alternative for verifying subclass-superclass relations, Noy and colleagues~\cite{Noy2013} introduce a vision for a tool support that would facilitate the integration of crowdsourcing into OE workflows. [TBD: ZenCrowd and CrowdMap are already approaches that attempt to enable embedded human computation, by making crowdsourcing a part of computational workflow to solve Semantic Web specific tasks such as ontology matching and  ]. The GATE Crowdsourcing Plugin is a first example of a plugin in a popular toolkit that allows crowdsourcing from within the tool.~\cite{Bontcheva2014}.  We present such a tool in this paper, that not only allows the ontology engineer to crowdsource subsumption verification, but also a set of other tasks that often appear in ontology engineering scenarios.


RQ1: Which tasks can be crowdsourced? How do they fit in the OE workflow?

RQ2: How to provide tool support for crowdsourcing in OE?

The contributions of this paper are: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item We distill a set of common crowdsourcing tasks that are likely to support a variety of ontology engineering tasks. 

\item We present a tool, the uComp Protege plugin, which allows ontology engineers to crowdsource tasks directly from within the popular ontology engineering tool and as part of their ontology engineering workflows.

\item We evaluate some of the functionality of the plugin to estimate the improvements made possible over manually solving a set of tasks in terms of time and cost reductions, while maintaining a similar data quality.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Use of Crowdsourcing for Knowledge Acquisition}

Crowdsourcing methods have been used to support several knowledge acquisition and, more specifically, ontology engineering tasks. To provide an overview of these methods we will group them along the three major stages of the Semantic Life-cycle as identified by Siorpaes in ~\cite{Siorpaes2008}, where Stage 1 and 2 cover our notion of ontology engineering [TBD - clarify]. The main points of the following discussion are summed up in Table \ref{table:tasksFromRW}.

\subsubsection{Stage 1: Build and maintain Semantic Web vocabularies}. Already in 2010, Eckert and colleagues~\cite{Eckert2010} relied on MTurk micro-workers  in the process of building a concept hierarchy in the philosophy domain. Judgements collected from micro-workers complemented the output of an automatic hierarchy learning method and focused on two main tasks:  judging the relatedness of concept pairs (5-points scale between unrelated and related) and specifying the level of generality between two terms (more/less specific than). 
Noy and colleagues~\cite{Noy2013} focus on the task of verifying subclass-superclass relations that make up the ontology hierarchy as a critical task while building ontologies. 
%Eckert - end goal: construction of hierarchies by aggregating human expert feedback on the relatedness and relative generality of terms; domain philosophy; Similar to us: "automatic OL methods are often weak on the task of determining the type of relation that holds between two terms" - I do not understand all details here ...

Games with a purpose, have also been used to support the process on ontology creation. 
%OntoPronto - decide whether a term is a class or an instance; then they relate this class to the most specific relevant PROTON class, therefore extending PROTON
 OntoPronto game~\cite{Siorpaes2008} aims to support the creation and extension of Semantic Web vocabularies. Players are presented with a Wikipedia page of an entity and they have to (1) judge whether this entity denotes a concept or an instance; and then (2) relate it to the most specific concept of the PROTON ontology, therefore extending PROTON with new classes and instances.  Climate Quiz~\cite{Scharl2012a} is a Facebook game where players evaluate whether two concepts presented by the system are related (e.g. “environmental activism”, “activism”), and which label is the most appropriate to describe this relation (e.g. “is a sub-category of”). The possible relations set contains both generic (“is a sub-category of”, “is identical to”, “is the opposite of”) and domain-specific (“opposes”, “supports”, “threatens”, “influences”, “works on/with”) relations. %Two further relations, “other” and “is not related to” were added for cases not covered by the previous eight relations. The game’s interface allows players to switch the position of the two concepts or to skip ambiguous pairs.
 Finally, Guess What?!~\cite{Markotschi2010} goes beyond eliciting or verifying relations between concepts and aims to create complex axioms to describe concepts in an ontology. The game explores instance data available as linked open data. Given a seed concept (e.g., banana), the game engine collects relevant instances from DBpedia, Freebase and OpenCyc and extracts the main features of the concept (e.g., fruit, yellowish) which are then verified through the collective process of game playing. The tasks performed by players are: (1) assigning a class name to a complex class description (e.g., assign $Banana$ to $fruit \& yellow \& grows\ on\ trees$) and (2) verifying previously generated class definitions.



\subsubsection{Stage 2: Align Semantic Web vocabularies}
The CrowdMap system enlists micro-workers to solve the ontology alignment task~\cite{Sarasua2012}. It relies on two types of atomic HITS: the first one, asks crowdworkers to verify whether a given relation is correct ("Is conceptA the same As conceptB? yes/no "); the second task, requests micro-workers to specify how two given terms are related, in particular by choosing between sameAs, isAKindOf and notRelated. CrowdMap is designed to allow sameAs, subsumption or generic mappings between classes, properties and axioms, but currently it only supports equivalence and subsumption mappings between classes. SpotTheLink  is a GWAP that  focuses on aligning Semantic Web vocabularies and has been instantiated to align the eCl@ss and UNSWPC~\cite{Siorpaes2008}  as well as  the DBPedia and PROTON ontologies~\cite{Thaler2011a}. The final version of the game, solves ontology alignment through two atomic tasks (1) choosing a related concept: given a DBPedia concept they need to choose and agree upon a related PROTON concept; (2) specifying the type of relation between two concepts in terms of equivalence or subsumption.

[TBD if time and place] Community focused efforts in Noy2013

\subsubsection{Stage 3: Annotate content and maintain annotations} ZenCrowd~\cite{Demartini2012} focuses on the entity linking problem, where crowd-workers are used to verify the output of automatic entity linking algorithms. Concretely, given a named entity, e.g., "Berlin", and a set of dbpedia URLs generated automatically, crowd-workers have to choose all the URLs that represent that entity or "None of the above" if no URL is suitable. In essence this is an annotation task. WhoKnows?~\cite{Waitelonis2011} and RISQ!~\cite{Wolf2011} are two games with a purpose which rely on similar mechanisms: they use LOD facts to generate questions and use the answers to (1) evaluate property ranking (which property of an instance is the most important/relevant); (2) detect inconsistencies; (3) find doubtful facts. The obtained property rankings reflect the “wisdom of the crowd” and are an alternative to semantic rankings generated algorithmically based on statistical and linguistic techniques. The games differ in the gaming paradigm they adopt. While WhoKnows?! uses a classroom paradigm and aims towards being an educational game, RISQ! is a Jeopardy-style quiz game.

 \subsection{Typical Crowdsourcing Task in Ontology Engineering}\label{ss:crowdtasks}

Based on the analysis of the crowdsourcing methods used to support ontology engineering tasks, it emerges that they often converge towards using a range of typical crowdsourcing tasks as follows. 

\begin{description}
\item[T1. Specification of Term Relatedness.]  Crowd-workers need to judge whether two terms (typically representing ontology concepts) are related or not. In some cases they are presented with pairs of terms (InPho ~\cite{Eckert2010}) while in others they might need to choose a most related term from a set of given terms (SpotTheLink ~\cite{Thaler2011a}). This type of crowdsourcing task is suitable to be used in diverse ontology engineering stages, for example, both in ontology creation scenarios  (InPho ~\cite{Eckert2010})  and in ontology alignment ones (SpotTheLink ~\cite{Thaler2011a}). 

\item[T2. Verification of Relation Correctness.] Presented with a pair of terms (typically representing ontology concepts) and a relation between these terms, crowd-workers are required to judge whether the suggested relation holds or not. The majority of the works we reviewed report on  verifying generic ontology relations such as equivalence ~\cite{Sarasua2012} and subsumption~\cite{Noy2013,Sarasua2012}, which are relevant both in ontology evaluation~\cite{Noy2013} and ontology alignment scenarios ~\cite{Sarasua2012}. 

\item[T3. Specification of Relation Type.] In these kinds of tasks, crowd-workers are presented with two terms (typically corresponding to ontology concepts) and can choose from a set of given relations the relation that best relates the terms. Most efforts focus on the specification of generic ontology relations such as  equivalence (Climate Quiz~\cite{Scharl2012a}, CrowdMap~\cite{Sarasua2012}, SpotTheLink~\cite{Thaler2011a} ), subsumption(Climate Quiz~\cite{Scharl2012a}, InPho~\cite{Eckert2010}, OntoPronto~\cite{Siorpaes2008}, CrowdMap~\cite{Sarasua2012}, SpotTheLink~\cite{Thaler2011a} ), disjointness (Climate Quiz~\cite{Scharl2012a}) or instanceOf (OntoPronto~\cite{Siorpaes2008}, Climate Quiz~\cite{Scharl2012a}). The verification of domain-specific named relations such as performed by Climate Quiz~\cite{Scharl2012a} is less frequent. 

% [BTW, since this is a complex task it could be split up into a sequence of 3 simpler tasks: 1) given two terms workers agree whether these are related or not; 2) those pairs that were judged related are then passed to another task where a correct relation is selected; 3) in the third task, the quality of the relations is checked - practically T2] Available relation labels are some predefined (like subClassOf) and those from the target ontology (all ObjectProperties) -- if more than 20 .. spread over multiple windows (depending on window size) Have a limit of 5 relation labels in the Protege interface All pairs with a certain relation (defined by the user in a text field, eg “relation”) are sent to the uComp API (or directly to CF). If you want to use just a subset of relations: have a window where you select (checkboxes) the actual pair to be sent. In CrowdFlower -- also have the choice to add a free text label output: be able to sort by certainty from CF ..

 %This is also a very difficult task in OL in general - the
\item[T4. Verification of Domain Relevance.]  For this task, the crowd-workers confirm whether a given term is relevant for a domain of discourse. This task is mostly needed to support scenarios where ontologies are extracted using automatic methods, for example, through ontology learning. 
\end{description}

The core crowdsourcing tasks we discuss above have been used by several approaches and across diverse stages of ontology (knowledge) engineering, therefore they are likely to be of interest in a wide range of ontology engineering scenarios. Therefore, they guided the development of our plugin, which currently supports tasks T2 and T4, as well as partially T3.


\section{The uComp Protege Plugin}

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\centering
{\centering \resizebox*{1.0\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{images/process.png}}}
 \caption{\label{fig:process} Main stages when using the uComp plugin.}
\end{figure*}

In order to support ontology engineers to easily and flexibly integrate crowdsourcing tasks within their ontology engineering workflows, we implemented a crowdsourcing plugin in Protege, one of the most widely used ontology editors. The typical workflow of using the plugin involves the following main stages (as also depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:process}).

\begin{description}
\item[1. Task Specification.] An ontology engineer using Protege can invoke the functionalities of the plugin  from within the ontology editor at any time within his current work. The plugin allows specifying some well defined ontology engineering tasks, such as those discussed in Section~\ref{ss:crowdtasks} above. The view of the plugin that is appropriate for the task at hand is added to the editor's user interface via the \emph{Window $\rightarrow{}$ Views} menu. The ontology engineer then specifies the part of the ontology to verify (eg. a specific class or all classes in the ontology), provides additional information and options in the plugin view and then starts the evaluation. Crowdsourced tasks can be canceled (or paused) anytime during the crowdsourcing process. We further detail the plugin's functionality in Section~\ref{ss:functionality}.

\item[2. Task Request]  The plugin uses the uComp API\footnote{TBD: is there an URL for this} to request the processing of the task by the crowd.


\item[3. Creation of Crowdsourcing Tasks.] The crowdsourcing process happens through the uComp platform\footnote{The platform is currently being developed as part of the uComp project, \url{http://www.ucomp.eu/}}, a hybrid-genre crowdsourcing platform which facilitates various knowledge acquisition tasks by flexibly crowdsourcing the received tasks to games with a purpose and mechanised labour platforms alike (in particular, CrowdFlower)~\cite{Sabou2013}. Depending on user settings, the uComp API delegates the job to a GWAP, to CrowdFlower or to a combination of these two genres. In Section~\ref{ss:crowdtasks} we present the crowdsourcing tasks created by the uComp platform.

\item[4\&5 Collection of Crowd Results.] The uComp platform collects and combines crowd-work harvested through various genres and sends the data to the plugin.

\item[6. Result Presentation and Interpretation.] As soon as available, the plugin presents the results to the ontology engineer and saves them in the ontology. All data collected by the plugin %which should be persistent [TBD - what is persistent?]
is stored in the ontology in \texttt{rdfs:comment} fields, for example information about the ontology domain, the crowdsourcing job ID, and the crowd-created results. Depending on the result, the ontology engineer will perform further actions such as deleting parts of the ontology which have been validated as non-relevant.
\end{description}

\subsection{Plugin Functionality}\label{ss:functionality}

The plugin provides a set of views for crowdsourcing the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\item Verification of Domain Relevance (T4)
\item Verification of Relation Correctness - Subsumption (T2)

\item Verification of Relation Correctness - InstnaceOf (T2) - the verification of \emph{instanceOf} relations between an individual and a class, i.e.~the crowd helps to verify if a given \emph{instanceOf} is valid.

\item Specification of Relation Type (T3) is a Protege view component that collects suggestions for labeling unlabeled relations by assigning to them a relation type from a set of relation types specified by the ontology engineer.

\item Verification of Domain and Range where crowd workers validate whether a property's \emph{domain} and \emph{range} are correct.
results in two separate sub-tasks (domain, range). [<=TBD: what does this do exactly] 

\end{itemize}


In this paper we focus on the description and evaluation of the first two functionalities.

%Florian: The CF key has to be associated with the uComp-API key, therefore it has to be communicated to the uComp-API team (see http://soc.ecoresearch.net/facebook/election2008/ucomp-quiz-beta/api/v1/documentation/)
%Florian: The uComp-API key itself must be put into a textfile named "ucomp_api_key.txt" at the users home directory, in the folder ".Protege" (which is created by Protege during installation on both Windows and Linux plattforms) 

%Florian: all information about the task is stored (depends on the kind of task): domain, validation of whole subtree going on?, additional information, sent to crowdflower or ucomp-quiz, ucomp-api job-id, ...

\end{figure*}
%[TBD: Gerhard: could you make a new screenshot, with another term that is more know and also shown highlighte in the left side hierarchy list - "climate" would be great. Also, can you add some example text in "Additional information for validators": for example: "You can  check any external resources if needed."]



% COMMON FIELDS in the UI: domain and additional information & validate subtree
% TASKs
\textbf{Verification of Domain Relevance (T4)} is supported by the ``uComp Class Validation'' view of the plugin and crowdsources the decision of whether  a concept (class) is relevant for a domain. First, the ontology engineer adds the corresponding view (\emph{Window} $\rightarrow{}$ \emph{Views} $\rightarrow{}$ \emph{Class Views} $\rightarrow{}$ \emph{uComp Class Validation}) to the editor's UI. Figure~\ref{fig:screen_cr} shows the screenshot of this view for the class ``fracking'' before initiating the verification. [TBD - how does the returned result look like? Do we have a screenshot?] The plugin view's interface contains the following information:

\begin{description}
\item[Task Specific Information] such as  the concept selected by the user for validation. This part of the view is diverse among different functionalities.
\item[Generic information]  such as the \emph{domain} of the ontology, i.e.,  the field of knowledge which the ontology covers, is present in all views of the plugin. If entered once, the domain will be stored in the ontology (as \texttt{rdfs:comment}) and be pre-filled subsequently, but it can also be changed at any time.
\item[Additional information] For every task, the plugin contains a predefined task description (typically including examples) which is presented to the crowd-worker. If the ontology engineer wants to extend this task description, (s)he can provide more guidelines in the \emph{additional information} field. This functionality is present in all the views of the plugin.
\item[Recursive control] In many cases the ontology engineer wants to perform a task (e.g., domain relevance validation) not only for the current class, but for a larger part of or even the whole ontology. If the \emph{Validate subtree} option is selected, the plugin crowdsources the specified task for the current concept and all its subconcepts recursively. To apply the functionality to  the entire ontology, the plugin is invoked from the uppermost class, i.e., (\emph{Thing}).
\item[ \texttt{GO} button] to start the crowdsourcing process. 
\end{description}


%Florian: domain will be stored as rdfs:comment in the head of the ontology

% T1. Verification of Domain Relevance.  Is a concept/instance relevant for a domain?
% T2. Verification of Relation Correctness. Does a certain relation between two ontology entities hold? These could be a set of generic relations (sameAs, subClassOf, instanceOf), but also arbitrary named relations to be specified by the ontology engineer. The crowd here would have to vote (yes/no) for a given triple (Subject - Relation - Object). This task is the focus of [1].

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\centering
{\centering \resizebox*{1.00\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{images/sc_subclass_val.png}}}
 \caption{\label{fig:screen_sub}Screenshot showing the interface for subClassOf relation validation, including the display of results}.
\end{figure*}


\textbf{Verification of Relation Correctness - Subsumption (T2).}
The second task is the verification of relation correctness, more precisely the verfication of IS-A (subClassOf) relations between classes.
The corresponding view is named \emph{Class Views} $\rightarrow{}$ \emph{uComp SubClass Validation}. When selecting a class in Protege,
the plugin automatically detects its superclasses (if any) and fills the boxes in the plugin UI.
As soon as results are available these are presented in the UI, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:screen_sub}. The screenshot gives an example
with one evaluator, who rated the \emph{IS-A} relation between ``education'' and ``business'' as invalid. As the majority of ratings is negative,
a button to remove the relation is displayed.

\subsection{Crowdsourcing Task Interfaces}\label{ss:crowdtasks}

Upon receiving the request from the Protege plugin, the uComp plugin selects the appropriate crowdsourcing genres and creates the relevant crowdsourcing jobs. Currently the platform can crowdsource tasks either to games with a purpose such as Climate Quiz or to the CrowdFlower mechanized labour platform. A hybrid-genre crowdsourcing strategy is currently being developed. In this paper, we test the plugin by crowdsourcing only to the CorwdFlower platform. 

Figure~\ref{fig:CFUI} depicts the crowdsourcing interfaces created automatically by the uComp platform for the two tasks discussed above, namely the verification of domain relevance and the validation of subsumption relations. The uComp platform requires only the task data from the Protege plugin and it provides relevant instructions as well as gold units to all tasks. Additionally, each crowdsourcing interface is extended with straightforward verification questions (i.e., typing some letters of the input terms) which force crowd-workers to actually read the data of each crowdsourcing unit and therefore take an informed decision rather than just clicking arbitrarily one of the responses.

   \caption{Generated CrowdFlower job interface for (a) the Verification of Domain Relevance  (T4) and (b) the Verification of Relation Correctness (T2)   tasks.}
   \label{fig:CFUI}
\end{figure}


To ensure a good quality output, by default all created jobs are crowdsourced to Level 3 CrowdFlower contributors which are the contributors delivering, on average, the highest quality work. Also, for the moment we assume that the verified ontologies will be in English and therefore we restrict contributors  to the main English speaking countries: Australia, United Kingdom and United Sates. In each created job we present 5 units per page and for each unit we collect 5 individual judgements. Future versions of the plugin will provide higher control over task settings from within Prot\'eg\'e.

\subsection{Implementation and Installation Details}

 Prot\'eg\'e was developed in Java, it can easily be extended in the form of \emph{plugins} which are typically Java Archive (.jar) files
stored in the  Prot\'eg\'e \texttt{plugin} directory. The most common form of a  Prot\'eg\'e plugin is a \emph{view plugin}, which implements a single view for a specific area of an ontology (e.g. classes, individuals, object properties).
%Florian: Protege completely was programmed in Java, therefore all plugins also are programmed in Java. Since Protege was developed very modular, it is quite easy to create simply plugins and integrate them into Protege. 
%Florian: All Protege plugins are so called jar-Files (Java Archive), and contains the compiled source code and all needed libraries. The most common form of a Protege plugin is a view plugin, which implements a single view for a specific area of an ontology (e.g. classes, individuals, object properties, ...)

% installation / SETUP 
\textbf{Installation and setup.}
The plugin is available at \url{TODO -- add link once uploaded to Protege}, includes detailed documentation about the tasks and
the usage of the plugin. TODO (if necessary) documentation is accessible at ..
To use the plugin you need to your uComp-API key\footnote{Request a key from the uComp team, see \url{http://soc.ecoresearch.net/facebook/election2008/ucomp-quiz-beta/api/v1/documentation/}} in a file named \texttt{ucomp\_api\_key.txt} in folder \texttt{.Protege}.

\subsection{Evaluation Scenario - Ontology Engineering using Ontology Learning}

Eckert has a similar scenario and Noy
%Eckert - end goal: construction of hierarchies by aggregating human expert feedback on the relatedness and relative generality of terms; domain philosophy; Similar to us: "automatic OL methods are often weak on the task of determining the type of relation that holds between two terms" - I do not understand all details here ...

Ontology construction from scratch is cumbersome and expensive (add citation?). Ontology learning supports the ontology
building process by providing an automatically generated starting point. As automatically generated ontologies
typically contain questionable or wrong ontological elements, a phase of redesign (especially pruning) is necessary.

In the ontology engineering scenario in this paper we aim to simplify the phase of pruning an ontology of concepts (classes)
not relevant to the domain, as well as of \emph{isA} relations that are not valid. The uComp Protege plugin also supports other
tasks, such as validating \emph{instanceOf} relations or checking \emph{domain/range} restrictions (see below), 
but these are not part of the evaluation in this publication.

The remainder of this section gives a brief introduction to the ontology learning system used.
The very first version of the system was published in 2005 (\cite{liu2005}), with improvements presented for example
in Weichselbraun et al.~\cite{weichselbraun2010dke} or Wohlgenannt et al.~\cite{wohlgenannt2012}. 
The system is geared towards learning lightweight domain ontologies from heterogeneous sources 
(text, social media, structured data). As we are learning domain ontologies in periodic intervals (monthly) from scratch, 
there is a focus on ontology evolution experiments, too.
In a nutshell, the process is as follows: The ontology learning framework starts from a small seed ontology 
(typically just a few concepts and relations), and extends this seed ontology with additional concepts and relations. 
Evidence for new concepts and relations is collected from heterogeneous evidence sources 
with methods such as co-occurrence analysis or Hearst patterns.
The neural network technique of spreading activation is the main algorithm used to determine the most important new concepts
from the plethora of evidence. After positioning the new concepts in the ontology, the extended ontology serves as
new seed ontology, and another round of extension is initiated. The system currently stops after three extension iterations.

\subsection{Evaluation Goal}
The goal of the evaluation is to assess the improvements that the uComp Plugin could enable in a typical ontology engineering scenario in terms of typical project completion aspects such as time, cost and quality of output. The usability of the plugin is an additional criteria that should be evaluated. Concretely, our evaluation goals can be summarised into the following questions:

\begin{description}
\item[Time] \textit{How does the use of the plugin affect the time needed to perform ontology engineering tasks?} - We distinguish here the total task time (Ttt) as the time taken from the start of the ontology engineering task until its finalisation; and the time of the ontology engineer spent actively in the task (Toe). In a crowdsourced scenario, Toe < Ttt, because the ontology engineer is only actively working during the outsourcing of the task and the review of the result. In contrast, in a traditional scenario Toe = Ttt. What is of interest to us is the time reduction ratio, that is (Ttt-Toe)/Ttt. (this will be computed as an average over multiple measurements, and over various ontology engineering tasks).

\item[Cost] \textit{Are there cost benefits associated with the use of the plugin?}  We compute costs related to payments for the involved work-force, that is payments to ontology experts and payments to crowd-workers. Costs of ontology experts are computed by multiplying the time they spend on the task (Toe) with an average salary. In order to allow comparison to other similar cost-focused studies [1], the wage of a research scientist was assumed to be \$54,000 per annum.

\item[Quality] \textit{What are the implications on the quality of the resulting output when using the Plugin?} Several earlier studies [e.g., Thalhammer’13, Sabou’13, Noy?, Sabou’13] have shown that the quality of the semantic tasks performed by crowd-workers is in general similar to (or even better than) the quality of tasks performed by ontology engineers. While the quality of the obtained data is not the core focus of our evaluation, we expect to obtain results similar to those already published [TBD: note however, that unlike earlier studies which focus on simple, atomic tasks, we focus on more complex engineering tasks - is this really true?]

\item[Usability] \textit{Is the plugin usable?} As any end-user tools, the plugin should be easy to understand and use by the average ontology engineer already familiar with the Protege environment.
\end{description}

\subsection{Evaluation Setup}

The setup involves working with two groups of ontology engineers, which will perform the same OE  tasks. 

\subsubsection{Evaluators}

\begin{description}
\item[Group 1]  This group used the traditional (that is manual) approach to perform the ontology engineering tasks.  It consisted of 8 ontology engineers
\item[Group 2] This group, consisting of 2 ontology engineers,  used the Plugin to perform the ontology engineering tasks. Group 2 was given a short tutorial about the plugin (30 minutes) and filled in a short usability questionnaire about using the plugin.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Evaluation Data}
The input to all evaluation tasks are ontologies generated by an ontology learning algorithm (primarily) from textual sources. 

For every ontology snapshot, ie. every result of an ontology learning stage, as well as the resulting ontology the system exports an OWL file (using the Turtle seralization format, which can be converted to RDF/XML easily).
The conversion of our internal format for lightweight ontologies is straightforward for concepts (which resemble to OWL classes). WordNet hyper- and hyponym relations are mapped to the OWL subClassOf property. The only challenging aspect is the representation of unlabeled relations in OWL. Our system creates ObjectProperties named "relation\_n", where "n" is an auto-incrementing number, as it is not possible to use the same ObjectProperty more than once. The label for those relations is plainly "relation". The periodically created versions of the domain ontology can be uploaded to a triple store and are thereby accessible via the SPARQL.

We evaluate the plugin over two ontologies covering two diverse domains. Some details of the input ontologies are:

\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|} \hline
&\textbf{Climate Change Ontology}&\textbf{Finance Ontology}\\ \hline

\textbf{Nr. of Un-named Relations} & 18  & 30 \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{Overview of the ontologies used in the experiments.}
\label{table:ontology_data}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Evaluation Tasks}
We perform the evaluation of the plugin over two different ontology engineering tasks in order to 1) test different functionalities of the plugin; 2) obtain evaluation result over a range of tasks.

Both user groups will perform the following tasks:

\begin{description}
\item[Task 1: Check concept relevance for a domain] For each concept of the ontology decide whether it is relevant for the domain in question (in our case, climate change and finance). Input: concept (class) and domain name; Output: true/false ratings -- we use a uComp\_class\_relevance annotation in Protege to save the results -- domain experts use true/false 

\item[Task 2: Check the correctness of isA relations] For all isA relations in the ontology verify whether they are correct. Manual experts set the value for a certain annotation uComp\_subclassof\_check 
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Evaluation Metrics}

For time:
For each participant measure Toe, and Ttt, for each task.
Compute averages per participant
Compute group averages and differences


 
For costs:
Compute avg costs per participant and per group and differences
 
For quality: Since we do not have a baseline, we will proceed as follows:
Task 1: compute pair-wise inter-expert agreement for both groups; and between groups – this will measure how different the output is between the plugin and non-plugin group. If it is small then the results are similar; Compute also Cohen’s Kappa
Task 2: same approach as with Task 1
Task 3: Here I think we should evaluate the quality of labels ourselves (em and Gerhard) for each produced ontology; and then  compute a precision value

%%%%% QUALITY

We have measured inter-rater agreement using the statistical measure of Fleiss' Kappa. 
Fleiss' Kappa assesses reliability of agreement with a fixed number of raters and categorical ratings assigned to a number of items.

Table~\ref{table:eval_qual} presents quality measures .. bla TODO.
Inter-rater agreement rates measured with Fleiss' Kappa are consistent and rather high, except for the class relevance verification task 
for the \emph{Climate Change} ontology. The number of raters per task is given in parantheses. TODO refine
\emph{Percentage valid} reflects the ratio of unit where the majority of raters confirm the validity.

Usability -- OLGA:
Although I didn't succeed to run the plug-in, i think, i could already answer the questions from the instructions file.

1)The documentation was easy to understand. 
-> 4, th part about installing plug-in was a bit of mixture with general info about protege and the installation itself.
2) The plugin functionality was easy to use.
-> 5 , it is especially good that one can choose to make the check for all ontology at once by choosing the "check the subtree".
3) I would prefer to use the plugin as opposed to doing these tasks manually.
-> 5
4) The use of the plugin saves a lot of time to the ontology engineer. 
-> 5
